# Perceptron-Tutorial

This tutorial is designed as an educational resource for the [Computational Neuroscience Imbizo 2023](https://imbizo.africa/). In this tutorial, we introduce foundational concepts around the perceptron, a simple type of artificial neural network model.

## Contents

- `Assignment.ipynb`: The main assignment notebook where you will apply and deepen your understanding of the perceptron model.
- `Assignment Answer.ipynb`: A solution notebook with answers for the assignment, useful for self-assessment.
- `The Perceptron.ipynb`: A detailed tutorial notebook that covers the basics of the perceptron model, including mathematical foundations, implementation steps, and applications.
- `resources/`: Contains additional resources, possibly data or images, to support the tutorial and assignments.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: This tutorial requires Python 3.x.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run and interact with the `.ipynb` notebooks.
- **Libraries**: The notebooks likely require libraries such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`. Install them with:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib
  ```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd Perceptron-Tutorial-main
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `The Perceptron.ipynb` to start with the tutorial and `Assignment.ipynb` to complete the exercises.
